# ✅ Approved Reports Now Use Preview Files Directly

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - Reports Page (`web/app/(main)/reports/page.tsx`)

**BEFORE:**
- Showed both AssetReports AND PdfReports as separate entries (duplicates)
- Approved AssetReports were skipped
- Downloads used local files via PdfReport records

**AFTER:**
- ✅ Shows ALL AssetReports (pending AND approved)
- ✅ Filters out PdfReports that belong to AssetReports (no duplicates)
- ✅ Approved AssetReports use preview_files URLs for downloads
- ✅ Sorting: Newest to oldest (already set as default)

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Skip PdfReports that belong to AssetReports
const assetReportIds = new Set(assetReports.map(ar => ar._id));
for (const r of reports) {
  const reportRef = (r as any).report as string | undefined;
  if (reportRef && assetReportIds.has(reportRef)) {
    continue; // Skip - AssetReport will handle downloads
  }
}

// Show all AssetReports including approved ones
for (const ar of assetReports) {
  // No longer skipping approved reports
  // They use preview_files URLs from R2
}
```

### 2. Backend - Approval Controllers

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/controller/approval.controller.ts`
- `server/src/controller/asset.controller.ts`

**BEFORE:**
- Admin approves → queueDocxGenerationJob runs
- Downloads preview files from R2
- Saves local copies
- Creates PdfReport records
- User downloads from local files

**AFTER:**
- ✅ Admin approves → ONLY updates status to 'approved'
- ✅ NO local file creation
- ✅ NO PdfReport records created
- ✅ User downloads SAME preview files from R2

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Disabled DOCX generation job
// NO LONGER NEEDED: Use preview_files URLs directly
// const { queueDocxGenerationJob } = await import("../jobs/assetReportJob.js");
// queueDocxGenerationJob(String(assetReport._id));
```
