/**
 * Generate Sample Mixed DOCX Report for Testing
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   npm run test:docx        (fast - no build required)
 *   npm run sample:docx      (production - with build)
 * 
 * This script generates a sample mixed-mode DOCX report in the ./reports directory.
 * 
 * Tests:
 * - Custom cover page (merged from coverPage.docx template)
 * - Headers with logo on all pages (except cover/certificate)
 * - Footers with page numbers and corporate info
 * - Certificate page with professional design
 * - Valuation comparison table with multiple methods
 * - Table of contents with proper page numbers
 * - All mixed report sections (Bundle, Per Item, Per Photo)
 * - Factors Affecting Value section with custom text
 * 
 * Technical Approach:
 * Uses PizZip for OOXML-level manipulation to prepend the custom cover page
 * while preserving all headers/footers in the main document. This avoids the
 * header/footer corruption issues present in docx-merger library.
 * 
 * Cover page: NO headers/footers (clean design)
 * Main document: YES headers/footers (preserved perfectly)
