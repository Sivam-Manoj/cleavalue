        <p class="mb-4">Dear {{owner_name}},</p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          At your request, we have prepared a real estate report of certain real
          estate owned by you, a copy of which is enclosed. This report is
          intended for your exclusive use along with your chosen agent and is
          intended only for establishing values of the subject property.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The subject property was evaluated under the premise of Fair Market
          Value for internal consideration. The cost and market approaches to
          value have been considered for this report and have either been
          utilized where necessary or deemed inappropriate for the value
          conclusions found therein.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          After a thorough analysis of the property and information made
          available to us, it is our opinion that as of the Effective Date,
          these assets have a Fair Market Value in Canadian Funds as shown on
          the certificate that we have prepared.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We certify that neither we nor any of our employees have any present
          or future interest in the appraised property. The fee charged for this
          report was not contingent on the values reported. As such, the results
          stated in this letter of transmittal cannot be fully understood
          without the accompanying report and this letter should not be
          separated from the report.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          If you require any additional information, please feel free to contact
          me at your convenience.

          The value stated in this evaluation report is based on the best

          The purpose of this report is to estimate fair market value for the

          SUMMARY OF VALUE CONCLUSIONS
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Based upon my analysis and the methodology, I estimate the Fair Market
          Value at {{fair_market_value_words}} ({{fair_market_value}}), as of
          {{report_dates.effective_date}}.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The scope of my work was an examination of information supplied by
          {{owner_name}} along with their chosen agent.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">SCOPE OF WORK</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">
          In my analysis, I considered all the approaches to value (i.e., the
          cost approach, the sales comparison approach, and the income
          approach). The appropriate approaches were then utilized, and the
          resulting value conclusions were reconciled.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The value opinions expressed in this report are contingent upon the
          analysis, facts, and conditions presented in the accompanying report.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          I, the appraiser do understand that this valuation is being prepared
          for financial consideration by {{owner_name}} along with their chosen
          agent.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Valuation process and methodology, the appraiser employed the
          following procedures to determine the value conclusions rendered
          herein:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-2">
          <li>
            Review and analysis of asset records and other informational
            materials.

          <li>
            Attended asset location to inspect and analyze the assets and

        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-semibold">FAIR MARKET VALUE (FMV):</strong> The
          price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer

          compulsion to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant
          facts.

        </h3>
        <p class="mb-2">
          This report and the above noted recovery values are based on a subject
          to the following conditions, qualifications, assumptions, and
          limitations:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-semibold">TITLE TO THE ASSETS:</strong> No
          investigation has been made of, and no responsibility is assumed for,
          the legal description or for legal matters including title or
          encumbrances. Unless otherwise noted in this report, title to the
          property is assumed to be good and marketable. The property is valued
          as if it is free and clear of liens, easements, encroachments, and
          other encumbrances unless otherwise stated, and all improvements are
          assumed to lie within property boundaries. Conducting a title search
          is outside the scope of this report.

        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-semibold">RESPONSIBLE OWNERSHIP:</strong> It is
          assumed that subject assets are under responsible ownership and
          competent management. No allowance has been made for possible liens or
          encumbrances that may be against the property other than those
          discussed in the report.

        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-semibold">STATED PURPOSE:</strong> This report and

          transmittal letter and the body of this report. This report cannot be
          used for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-semibold">VALUATION DATE:</strong> The valuation
          date to which the conclusions and opinions expressed in this report
          apply is set forth in the transmittal letter and in the report. The
          dollar amount of any value reported is based on the purchasing power
          of the Canadian dollar (or the currency specified in the report) as of
          that date.

        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-semibold">INSPECTION:</strong> The subject assets
          were inspected as noted in the body of the report. When the date of
          inspection differs from the valuation date, we have assumed no
          material change in the condition of the property unless otherwise
          noted in the report.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          <strong class="font-semibold">HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES:</strong> No
          allowance has been made nor was any consideration given to potential
          environmental problems and the possible impact those problems would
          have on the findings withing this report. It is assumed that there is
          full compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and laws
          unless non-compliance is stated, defined and considered in the report.
          We have not been engaged nor are we qualified to detect the existence
          of hazardous material, which may or may not be present on or near the
          property. The presence of potentially hazardous substances may affect
          the value of the property. The value estimate herein is predicated on
          the assumption that there is no such material on, in or near the
          property that would cause a loss in vale. No responsibility is assumed
          for any such conditions or for any expertise or engineering knowledge
          required to discover them. The client should retain an expert in this
          field if further information is desired.

          <strong class="font-semibold">METHOD OF VALUATION:</strong> Since
          conclusions by the appraiser are based upon judgements, isolation of
          any single element as the sole basis for comparison to the whole
          report may be inaccurate. The effective date of the report establishes
          the current value and is not prospective or retrospective. These
          values have been determined by my experience as a previously licensed
          REALTOR® and in consultation with active and recent sales through
          {{inspector_info.company_name}} Online Auction, Farmland Security
          Board, as well as active listings available through the Multiple
          Listing System (MLS®), etc. This property was assessed by multiple
          methods before arriving at my conclusion. The method chosen and
          applied in the evaluation of this property was The Direct Comparison
          Approach. The Direct Comparison method determines an estimate of value
          by comparing properties which are similar to the subject and are
          currently listed or recently sold. This approach most closely
          represents behaviors of typical buyers and sellers of real estate.
