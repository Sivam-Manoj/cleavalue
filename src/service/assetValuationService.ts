- Description: ${assetDescription || "N/A"}
- Condition: ${assetCondition || "Unknown"}
- Industry: ${industry || "General"}
- Base Fair Market Value (FMV): $${baseFMV.toLocaleString()}

**Valuation Methods to Calculate:**

1. **FML (Fair Market Value)** - Always 100%
2. **TKV (Trade Value)** - Typical range: 60-80% of FMV
3. **OLV (Orderly Liquidation Value)** - Typical range: 70-85% of FMV
4. **FLV (Forced Liquidation Value)** - Typical range: 40-65% of FMV

**Instructions:**
Consider the following factors when determining percentages:
- Asset type and marketability
- Condition and age
- Industry demand
- Liquidity (how quickly it can be sold)
- Specialized vs. general-purpose equipment
- Market conditions

Return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure (no markdown, no explanations):

  "TKV": 70,
  "OLV": 77,
  "FLV": 52
