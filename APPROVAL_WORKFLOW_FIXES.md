# Approval Workflow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Reports Show in Approvals Before Files Are Ready
**Problem:** When users submitted a preview, it immediately appeared in admin approvals, but the files (DOCX, XLSX, ZIP) were still being generated in the background.

**Solution:**
- Changed initial status from `'pending_approval'` to `'preview'` in `asset.controller.ts`
- Status is now changed to `'pending_approval'` AFTER files are created in `runPreviewFilesJob`

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/controller/asset.controller.ts` (line 233)
- `server/src/jobs/assetReportJob.ts` (line 154-159)

**Flow:**
```
User Submits â†’ Status: 'preview' â†’ Background Job Starts
                                         â†“
                                   Files Created
                                         â†“
                           Status: 'pending_approval' â†’ Shows in Admin Approvals
```

### 2. âœ… Approved Reports Don't Show in User's Reports List
**Problem:** After admin approved a report, it didn't appear in the user's reports page. Only old PdfReports were shown.

**Solution:**
- Updated `getReportsByUser` to query BOTH `PdfReport` AND approved `AssetReport`
- Converted AssetReports to match PdfReport format for frontend compatibility
- Combined and sorted by `createdAt` (newest first)

**Files Changed:**
- `server/src/controller/pdfReport.controller.ts` (line 126-197)

**Query:**
```typescript
// Old-style reports
const pdfReports = await PdfReport.find({ user: req.userId })

// New-style approved reports  
const approvedAssetReports = await AssetReport.find({ 
  user: req.userId,
  status: 'approved'
})

// Combined and sorted by newest first
```

---

### 3. âœ… Newest Reports Appear First
**Problem:** Reports weren't consistently ordered by newest first.

**Solution:**
- Added explicit sort by `createdAt` descending
- Both PdfReports and AssetReports are sorted individually
- Combined result is sorted again to ensure newest first

**Code:**
```typescript
const allReports = [...pdfResults, ...assetResults].sort((a, b) => {
  return new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime();
});
```

## Status Workflow

### Before Fix:
```
Submit â†’ pending_approval (immediate) â†’ Files generating in background
                â†“
         Shows in approvals (but files not ready yet!)
```

### After Fix:
```
Submit â†’ preview â†’ Files generating in background
                        â†“
                   Files ready
                        â†“
              pending_approval â†’ Shows in approvals
                        â†“
                   Admin approves
                        â†“
                   approved â†’ Shows in user's reports
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Preview Submission
1. User creates and submits preview
2. **Expected:** Report does NOT immediately appear in admin approvals
3. Wait for background job to complete (~30-60 seconds)
4. **Expected:** Report appears in admin approvals with all 3 files ready

**Server Logs:**
```
[PreviewFilesJob] Starting for report 123...
âœ… Files created and status set to pending_approval for report 123
[PreviewFilesJob] Completed for report 123
```

### Test 2: Admin Approval
1. Admin approves a report
2. **Expected:** Report status changes to 'approved'
3. User refreshes their reports page
4. **Expected:** Approved report appears at the TOP of the list

### Test 3: Report Ordering
1. Create 3 reports on different days
2. **Expected:** Newest report appears first
3. Older reports appear below in chronological order

## Database Fields

### AssetReport Model:
```typescript
{
  status: 'draft' | 'preview' | 'pending_approval' | 'approved' | 'declined',
  preview_data: { ... },  // Editable report data
  preview_files: {        // Generated files (set by background job)
    docx: string,
    excel: string,
    images: string
  },
  preview_submitted_at: Date,      // When user submitted
  approval_requested_at: Date,     // When files were ready
  approval_processed_at: Date      // When admin approved/declined
}
```
